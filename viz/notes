////// For country/year viz //////
Formulation of questions a-priori answered by the viz:
	- (country) How does a country compare to others?
	- (year) How has inequality evolved worldwide over the years?
General remarks:
	- Kinda hard to see what exactly the gradient/color represent
	- Some entries (Korea, Slovenia...) seem bugged: gradient "reversed"?
	- What is the data based on: last year, average of all years?
Possible interractions:
	- On rectangle/country mousehover, highlight target country and draw a temporary plot of all the years for selected country
	- Allow swapping between year/country on the fly, OR make it 2 sepparate viz? (Both are interesting but answer separate questions)
	- (MAYBE) allow grouping by region: change color & position in consequence? Would require to change the structure of the dataset (add a row with the region in the list of countries)
Suggestions:
	- Maybe add axis names for clarity? 
	- If we get access to GINI index, how about an ordering of the countries based on it? Maybe then 1color = 1region might look great idk

////// Graph to compare gini index evolution over time for several countries  //////
	- y : Gini index
	- x : Evolution over time
	- Between selected countries (maximum of ~5-6?) OR by region
